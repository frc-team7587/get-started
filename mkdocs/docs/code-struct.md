## Basic Code Structure
How does the Java code of a robot program look like? Read following few pages on WPI site and you'll get a better understanding.

## Layout
Read the explanation of the Java robot project code layout here:

>**Note:** Never mind the *RobotBuilder* mentioned there, we're only interested in the code it generates.

## Command-based Programming
Visit the WPILib site chapter [FRC Java Programming](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java), expand the menu item "*Command based programming*" on the left to see sub-topics, read at least the first three topics. You'll need to understand two fundamental concepts: **Subsystems** and **Commands**.

>**Note:** The corresponding section in the new **[frc-doc](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/)**  site is **[here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/index.html)**. It is advised that we continue use the current site before the 2020 seasion officially starts (i.e. when the WPILib software installation package is updated with the new library).

## Base Robot Class
The base robot class determines the code structure and pattern used in your robot code. Read this article [Choosing a Base Class](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599697-choosing-a-base-class) to understand base robot coding patterns. You'll see that the recommended base robot class is **TimedRobot**.

>Tip: Bookmark the [WPILib API](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/), you'll need it.
