# Basic Code Structure
Now it's time to dive a little deeper to robot programming. **How does the Java code of a robot look like?** Read a few pages on WPI site and you'll get a better understanding fairly quick:

### Layout
Read the explanation of the Java robot project code layout here: [https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/robotbuilder/l/292704-robotbuilder-created-code](
https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/robotbuilder/l/292704-robotbuilder-created-code).

>**Note:** You don't need to know about the RobotBuilder tool mentioned in the document. The goal is for you to write the robot code rather than relying on the RobotBuilder to create code for you.

### Command-based Programming
Visit the WPILib site chapter [FRC Java Programming](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java), expand the menu item "Command based programming" on the left to see sub-topics, read at least the first three topics.

### Base Robot Class
The base robot class determines the code structure and pattern used in your robot code. Read this article [Choosing a Base Class](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599697-choosing-a-base-class) to understand base robot coding patterns. You'll see that the recommended base robot class is **TimedRobot**.

>Tip: Bookmark the [WPILib API](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/), you'll need it.
