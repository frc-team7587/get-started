# Your First Robot Program
Now that you have set up your development environment, it's time to try connecting your laptop to the roboRIO, and create your first (test) robot program!

### Driver Station Connectivity
At minimum, you'll need to connect the following components on the robot electrical board:

Battery -> Power breaker -> PDP


PDP -> RoboRIO



### Create Project in VSCode
